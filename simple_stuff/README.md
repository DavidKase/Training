# Short python exercises

## Reverse number
Write function which takes number as argument in form of string. Then convert it to a number type (expect no decimal) and print it backwards.
```
def reverse_number(string_number):
    ...
```

---

## Fibonacci number
Write function which takes position **n** as argument and then prints **n**-th number from Fibonacci Sequence.

```
def fibonacci_number(number):
    ...
```

> ### Fibonacci Sequence
> Each number is sum of previous two members from sequence.
> First two members are 0 and 1.
>
>eg. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

1
```

```

    1 2 3 
      1 2 
        1
```

```
  1 1 1   
1   2   1
1 2   2 1
1   2   1
  1 1 1  
```

## Prime numbers
Display all the prime numbers within a range

    ...
```
